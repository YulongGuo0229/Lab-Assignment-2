Read meIn my main code, I set one array to collect all the user¡¯s input from keyboard for the numbers. And then I also set an int to collect the target number from user. Then, I trans all the data to TwoSum function. In TwoSum, I set a ¡°if¡± statement, if minimum two numbers are smaller than target or max two numbers are bigger than target, the for loops will not be processed to follow Recommendation 1. And I use two for loops to try different solutions. In addition, I set another class called "PrintArray" to return the indices of value from original array. And it will return the original indices. If there are two same value in original array, it will output two different indices for two values. The running time for my code is O(n^2).
